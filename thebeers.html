<h1>Our Beers</h1>

<h3>The Titans:</h3>
<div class="deets">These are the original standards. Big, bold, and mostly Belgian.</div>
<ul>
<li><span>Tranquility Tripel</span> - apricot, citrus, and spice in a light 8.8% ABV beer that drinks easy like a session beer. Gold medal 2015 Colorado State Fair.</li>

<li><span>Scorpiris Saison</span> - A healthy dose of late addition Sorachi Ace gives this beer a light lemon cream and berry flavor that compliments the peppery yeast esters.</li>

<li><span>Sanctuary Golden Strong Ale</span> - Everyone has their sanctuary. Ours is making beer. This Belgian style beer has complex notes of pear and apple and hides its alcohol well.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Olympians:</h3>
<div class="deets">Vying for supremacy with the titans, these tend to be a mix of German lagers and darker malty beers.</div>
<ul>
<li><span>(e)scape goat bock</span> - Sometimes no matter what you do you're gonna be the goat. When that happens you should have a nice beer to focus on instead. Notes of chocolate, caramel , herbs and cola.</li>

<li><span>Pistols at Dawn Baltic Porter</span> - Skip the duel and settle it over a beer. Our rich porter is brewed with a mix of ale and lager yeast. Chocolate, caramel and stone fruit from the malts blend with a slight yeast fruitiness and a clean finish.</li>

<li><span>Erebus Imperial Stout</span> - Named for the primordial creator of darkness from Greek mythology. We use buckwheat in this big, rich stout for an additional layer of depth. Aged in fresh bourbon barrels for six months to a year.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Demigods:</h3>
<div class="deets">Collaborations and tests. These showcase our experimental side and rotate frequently.</div>
<ul>
<li><span>Pumpkin Latte Stout</span> - collaboration with Echo and Gravity</li>

<li><span>Lemongrass Kottbusser</span> - in planning</li>
</ul>
